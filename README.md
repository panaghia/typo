# Typo

This is a typographic demo made during the Moze's course “Creative Developer”.

The goal is to explore ways to use wisely typographic elements in a simple task like a one page site.

For the demo I chose to represent a quote from Turoldo with two fonts:

- heading: [Grad](http://www.marksimonson.com/fonts/view/grad) by Phil Martin / Mark Simonson Studio
- body: [Utopia Std](https://typekit.com/fonts/utopia-std) by Robert Slimbach / Adobe
